### CAVE Systems:
CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment) systems utilize multiple screens as walls, motion tracking systems, and Stereoscopic 3D glasses to create an immersive VR experience. The advantage of a CAVE system over other VR systems is that it can utilize the user's peripheral vision and developers could take advantage of the space provided to utilize physical props, such as treadmills. However, a CAVE system is very expensive, requiring multiple high resolution displays, powerful computing hardware, and a large space to set up the system.

### Objective:
- Simulate a 3-wall CAVE
- Switch the viewport between HMD (Head Mounted Display) and Controller view to simulate spectating the a user utilizing the CAVE system
- Freeze the viewport for same reason above
- Debug Mode to visualize the perspective projections onto each wall
